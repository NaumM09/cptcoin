          <p>
            <strong>Experience the Future of Decentralized Awareness</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The South Africa Token (SAT) is a blockchain-based digital asset designed <strong>exclusively for advocacy and social impact</strong>. It is not a financial instrument, nor is it intended for speculative trading or investment purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            SAT serves as a <strong>symbol of solidarity</strong> with the people of Palestine and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), bringing attention to human rights violations, economic injustices, and humanitarian crises in these regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This token carries <strong>no monetary value</strong> outside its intended purpose. It is a <strong>non-tradable digital asset</strong> meant to amplify global awareness, mobilize communities, and facilitate transparent donations to reputable humanitarian organizations.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Mission & Vision</h2>

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Raise Global Awareness:</strong> SAT aims to highlight systemic injustices, economic struggles, and humanitarian crises that often go unnoticed. The token serves as a <strong>decentralized educational tool</strong>, leveraging blockchain technology to provide verifiable information and updates about ongoing issues in Palestine and the DRC.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Promote Decentralized Advocacy:</strong> Traditional media and centralized institutions often fail to amplify grassroots movements. SAT enables <strong>decentralized advocacy</strong>, empowering individuals to spread awareness without the risk of censorship or suppression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitate Transparent Donations:</strong> A portion of the token supply is allocated for humanitarian aid and relief efforts. Through blockchain technology, every donation can be tracked, ensuring that contributions reach legitimate organizations supporting affected communities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            Our vision is to establish <strong>a digital movement</strong> that seamlessly integrates activism with blockchain transparency. By creating a decentralized ecosystem of awareness and support, SAT will allow individuals worldwide to <strong>participate in human rights advocacy, economic justice, and direct action</strong> through innovative technology.

          <h2>3. Purpose & Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike cryptocurrencies designed for financial transactions, SAT is <strong>not meant for speculative investment or trading</strong>. The token exists solely to support social impact efforts. Below are the key characteristics and limitations of SAT:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>No Financial Value:</strong> SAT does not represent a form of currency, nor does it hold any intrinsic market value. It is not pegged to any fiat currency or commodity, and its issuance is strictly for <strong>awareness-building and activism</strong> rather than financial gain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not for Trading or Investment:</strong> SAT is <strong>not listed on exchanges</strong> and cannot be bought, sold, or traded. Any attempt to create a market around SAT <strong>goes against its intended purpose</strong> and will not be endorsed by the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Educational and Awareness-Based Use Only:</strong> The token serves as <strong>a digital representation of advocacy efforts</strong>, allowing users to engage with humanitarian initiatives, learn about socio-economic issues, and contribute to global discussions in a meaningful way.
            </li>
          </ul>
