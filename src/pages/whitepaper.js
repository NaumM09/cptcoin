          <p>
            The South Africa Token (SAT) is a blockchain-based digital asset designed **exclusively for advocacy and social impact**. It is not a financial instrument, nor is it intended for speculative trading or investment purposes.

          </p>
          <p>
            This token carries **no monetary value** outside its intended purpose. It is a **non-tradable digital asset** meant to amplify global awareness, mobilize communities, and facilitate transparent donations to reputable humanitarian organizations.

          <h2>2. Mission & Vision</h2>

          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Raise Global Awareness:</strong> SAT aims to highlight systemic injustices, economic struggles, and humanitarian crises that often go unnoticed. The token serves as a **decentralized educational tool**, leveraging blockchain technology to provide verifiable information and updates about ongoing issues in Palestine and the DRC.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Promote Decentralized Advocacy:</strong> Traditional media and centralized institutions often fail to amplify grassroots movements. SAT enables **decentralized advocacy**, empowering individuals to spread awareness without the risk of censorship or suppression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Facilitate Transparent Donations:</strong> A portion of the token supply is allocated for humanitarian aid and relief efforts. Through blockchain technology, every donation can be tracked, ensuring that contributions reach legitimate organizations supporting affected communities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>
            Our vision is to establish **a digital movement** that seamlessly integrates activism with blockchain transparency. By creating a decentralized ecosystem of awareness and support, SAT will allow individuals worldwide to **participate in human rights advocacy, economic justice, and direct action** through innovative technology.

          <h2>3. Purpose & Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike cryptocurrencies designed for financial transactions, SAT is **not meant for speculative investment or trading**. The token exists solely to support social impact efforts. Below are the key characteristics and limitations of SAT:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>No Financial Value:</strong> SAT does not represent a form of currency, nor does it hold any intrinsic market value. It is not pegged to any fiat currency or commodity, and its issuance is strictly for **awareness-building and activism** rather than financial gain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Not for Trading or Investment:</strong> SAT is **not listed on exchanges** and cannot be bought, sold, or traded. Any attempt to create a market around SAT **goes against its intended purpose** and will not be endorsed by the project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Educational and Awareness-Based Use Only:</strong> The token serves as **a digital representation of advocacy efforts**, allowing users to engage with humanitarian initiatives, learn about socio-economic issues, and contribute to global discussions in a meaningful way.
            </li>
          </ul>
